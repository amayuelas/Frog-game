# Frog-game
This is another project from my Methodology of programming class at university. We were asked to develop the very well-known game of the game in C++. For those who don't, it is a frog that has to cross over a road with many cars and truck coming and going. 

It is further practice on Object Oriented Programming, with implementation of different classes, input/output system to save the results, implementation of a queue and some recursive functions as the result of the Divide and Conquer paradigm
There are clases for:
- Area (Area)
- Frog (Granota)
- Vechicle (Vechicle)
- Lane on the road (Carril)
- Chronometer (Cronometre)
- Queue (Cua)
- Iterator (Iterador)
- Node (Node)
- Game (Joc)
- Menu (Menu)
- Obstacle (Obstacle)
- Screen (Pantalla)
- Main (Principal)
- Scores (Puntuacions)

# Execution instructions
In the directory ./Program there is the .exe file ready to be played
